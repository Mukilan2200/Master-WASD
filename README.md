# Master-WASD
I built Máster Your WÁSÐ using Python with the libraries; pygame and time. It’s a strict little game that trains you to ditch the arrow keys and switch to WASD. If you hit an arrow key, it throws a fun warning. I made it for Code in Place, and it really helped me sharpen my logic and game dev skills.
